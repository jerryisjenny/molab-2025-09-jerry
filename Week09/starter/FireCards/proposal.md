My final project idea is a software designed to counter appearance anxiety. On the surface, it looks like a regular photo editing app, but in reality it only allows users to apply various “glitch face” effects to detected faces—leaning toward uncanny, playful, and experimental aesthetics. After the user finishes editing, I plan to use AI to transform their face into a three-dimensional model and display it.

Through this project, I want to express that everyone has their own sense of aesthetics and there is no need to follow mainstream beauty standards. The definition of beauty should be something we shape and reclaim for ourselves.
