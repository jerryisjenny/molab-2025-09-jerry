My final project is an app which can add glitch effects on the face in the image and makes a 3d model based on the edited image. When people open this app, they should upload an image which has only one face on it or take a photo instantly. After detect the face sucessfully, they can add different effects on it, the ideal result is the effect only influences the face part in the photo. After finishing edition, they can choose to save the edited image or produce the 3d model based on the photo.
1. Nov14-Nov21: Start to learn the code of make 3d model from image and try to find the minimum number of photos it needs. And also finish the glitch filter part(include allow user take photo instantly). 2. Nov21-Nov26: Keep learning on making 3d model from image cause I think it will take me a lot of time. 3. Nov26-Dec05: Combine all the parts together. If time is enough, maybe make an easy animation at the start of the app?
