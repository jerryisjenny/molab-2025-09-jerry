# Week 03 Notes

I spent about eight hours in total studying the content from Day 11 to Day 14. 
When learning about structs, I relied on my prior understanding of classes to make sense of them, so this time I first spent quite a bit of time understanding the differences between the two. Since my previous knowledge of classes was not systematic, I focused mainly on two questions in the class module: How to add initializers for classes and How to create a deinitializer for a class.

The content in Day 13 and Day 14 was also a completely new area for me, so I spent extra time trying to understand them. I made use of AI to generate practical examples and analyze the functions of these concepts, but perhaps because my current understanding of code is still limited to relatively shallow, visual feedback, I still find the aspects related to data processing rather abstract. Next week, I will focus on summarizing the knowledge points that Iâ€™m still not familiar with and organize them into a separate document to serve as supplementary material.
